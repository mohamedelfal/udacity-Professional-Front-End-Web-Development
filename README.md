# SYLLABUS 
The goal of the Udacity NANODEGREE PROGRAM:[Professional Front End Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build and develop a variety of websites and applications. Graduates of this Nanodegree program will be able to construct responsive websites using CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grid, develop interactive websites and UI (User Interface) applications using JavaScript and HTML, and connect a web application to backend server data using JavaScript. Students will also build competency automating application build and deployment using Webpack and improving offline performance of websites using Service Worker.


 # Moudel 3 *[JavaScript & The DOM]* Project
 ># Landing Page
 >> the Project starter code [here](./Project-1-Landing-Page/Starter-Code/) or [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page)<br>
 >> Build a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience for the user.
 > ## [Project Introduction](./Project-1-Landing-Page/1-Project-Introduction.md)

>>## Project Summary
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

>>## What You Will Build
You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work. You’ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you find this process to be quick, there’s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve the users’ experience.

>>## What will I learn?
The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:

* What’s the ideal workflow?
* How many files do I need?
* Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
* How many JavaScript functions do I need?
* Should my function be this many lines of code?
* Is readability or performance more important?

There’s no single correct answer to each question. While building this project, working with peers, and getting feedback from the project reviewer -- you will naturally develop your own answers to these questions!

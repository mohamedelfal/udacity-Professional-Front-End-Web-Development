# Getting Started
## Introduction<br>
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to
dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.<br>
## Project Rubric<br>
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Weather-Journal project
rubric. Please review the rubric for detailed project requirements. If you'd like to start from
scratch without any files, you are encouraged to do so! You learn the most by developing on your
own. But, it can be a bit challenging having to start from scratch, so we do provide a starter
project (i.e., a "skeleton") to use.<br>
## Get the Starter Code<br>
You can download the starter code below by cloning the speci√íc branch 'refresh-2019':
* [The Weather Journal project repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019)
The starter code has all the elements and CSS you will need to complete the project, plus a little
help getting started with the JavaScript. If you decide to start development on your own and then
get stuck, you can always take a peek at the starter code available at the links provided for
inspiration.
If you want to try the project without the starter code, and would like to use a comments only
version of the finished JS code, you can find that at the link below.
* [Comments only version of fnal JS code](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app/commentsOnlyJS) ( `commentsOnlyJS`  directory)<br>
## Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications<br>
Great! You now have the starter code. Before moving forward, make sure you are comfortable
with the content from Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications.
Ask yourself:
* How do I setup a [Node environment with Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction) and the necessary project dependencies?
* How do I setup a [server with GET and POST routes?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
* How do I create developer credentials for a Web API?
* How do I use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my
* app routes?
* How do I access a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side?
* How do I [chain Promises](https://javascript.info/promise-chaining) together
* How do I access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically?

# Get the Starter Code
you can download the starter code from [here](./weather-journal-app.zip)<br>
Or<br>
You can download the starter code below by cloning the specific branch 'refresh-2019':<br>
[The Weather Journal project repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019)<br>
The starter code has all the elements and CSS you will need to complete the project, plus a little help getting started with the JavaScript. If you decide to start development on your own and then get stuck, you can always take a peek at the starter code available at the links provided for inspiration.

If you want to try the project without the starter code, and would like to use a comments only version of the finished JS code, you can find that at the link below.

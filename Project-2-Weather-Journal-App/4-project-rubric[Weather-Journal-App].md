**PROJECT SPECIFICATION**
# Weather Journal App

**Project Environment Setup**
|CRITERIA |MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|
|:--------|:------|
|Node and Express Environment|Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. The project file `server.js` should require `express()`, and should create an instance of their app using express. The Express app instance should be pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files|
|Project Dependencies|The ‘cors’ package should be installed in the project from the command line, required in the project file `server.js`, and the instance of the app should be setup to use `cors()`.<br>The `body-parser` package should be installed and included in the project.|
|Local Server|Local server should be running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function.|
|API Credentials|Create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com <br>Note: The following line of code should be at the top of the app.js file: <br> ``// Personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API const apiKey = '<your_api_key>&units=imperial';`` <br>* The actual API key itself will be different for everyone. <br>* Notice the last part ‘&units=imperial’-- this should be included in the saved variable.|

**APIs and Routes**
|CRITERIA |MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|
|:--------|:------|
|APP API Endpoint|There should be a JavaScript Object named `projectData` initiated in the file `server.js` to act as the app API endpoint. <br>Tip: Near the top of the file server.js there should be a line of code that creates an empty JavaScript object:``projectData = {   }   ``|
|Integrating OpenWeatherMap API|The personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API is saved in a named `const` variable.<br>The API Key variable is passed as a parameter to `fetch()`.<br>Data is successfully returned from the external API.<br>In the file `app.js`, there should be a line of code near the top:<br> ``   // Personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API   const apiKey = '<your_api_key>&units=imperial';``   Note: The personal API key must be stored in a const variable.|
|Return Endpoint Data <br> GET Route I: Server Side|There should be a GET route setup on the server side with the first argument as a string naming the route, and the second argument a callback function to return the JS object created at the top of server code.|
|Return Endpoint Data<br>GET Route II: Client Side|There should be an asynchronous function to fetch the data from the app endpoint|
|POST Route|You should be able to add an entry to the project endpoint using a POST route setup on the server side and executed on the client side as an asynchronous function. The client side function should take two arguments, the URL to make a POST to, and an object holding the data to POST. The server side function should create a new entry in the apps endpoint (the named JS object) consisting of the data received from the client side POST. <br>Tip: Implement async calling by the use of promise chaining where you will pass the the mix of API and user responses, to POST endpoint on server side. The POST route in the server side should setup which will map the data sent via the API from the client side and save it in the projectData variable.|

**Dynamic UI**
|CRITERIA |MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|
|:--------|:------|
|Naming HTML Inputs and Buttons For Interaction|The `input` element with the `placeholder` property set to “enter zip code here” should have an `id` of `zip`.<br>The `textarea` included in project HTML should have an `id` of `feelings`. The button included in project HTML should have an `id` of `generate`.|
|Assigning Element Properties Dynamically|The div with the `id`, `entryHolder` should have three child divs with the ids:<br> **`date`<br> `temp`<br>`content`<br>`Event Listeners`**|
|Adds an event| listener to an existing HTML button from DOM using Vanilla JS. In the file app.js, the element with the id of generate should have an addEventListener() method called on it, with click as the first parameter, and a named callback function as the second parameter.|
|Dynamically Update UI|Sets the properties of existing HTML elements from the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript. Included in the async function to retrieve that app’s data on the client side, existing DOM elements should have their innerHTML properties dynamically set according to data returned by the app route.<br>Note: Function to GET Project Data:<br> ```  const retrieveData = async () =>{  const request = await fetch('/all');   try {   // Transform into JSON   const allData = await request.json()   console.log(allData)   // Write updated data to DOM elements   document.getElementById('temp').innerHTML = Math.round(allData.temp)+ 'degrees';   document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = allData.feel;  document.getElementById(""date"").innerHTML =allData.date;   }   atch(error)   console.log(""error"", error);   // appropriately handle the error   ```|

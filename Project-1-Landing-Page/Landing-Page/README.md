##  project description

The Landing Page [HTML page] consists of:

* Nav bar ( dynamically created based on the sections of the page )

* Main hero section

* Four sections

* footer


## Requirements

* Build out HTML and at least 3 content sections ( provided in the starter code) [+ added one more section]
* Build the navigation menu
* Add functionality to distinguish the section in view
* Add the functionality to scroll to sections


## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
